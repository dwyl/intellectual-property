All _**questions**_ (_and **answers**_!) relating to intellectual property.

At dwyl we _firmly_ believe that [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) is the _**only**_ way software should be released.

We want _**everyone**_ to be able to use the **dwyl app** regardless of

If you do not _share_ the belief that Open Source is the _future_ of code, please tell us _**exactly**_ why and give us _**specific example**_ of a situation where you think closed source is better. _Thanks_!
