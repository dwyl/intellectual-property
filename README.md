# intellectual property

All _**questions**_ (_and **answers**_!) relating to intellectual property.

> "Intellectual property (IP) is a term referring to creations of the intellect for which a monopoly is assigned to designated owners by law."
~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property


At dwyl we _firmly_ believe that [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) is the _**only**_ way software should be released. We do not _want_ to have a "Monopoly" on the things we build and that's _exactly_ why this document exists!



Open Source _reduces_ (_often eliminates_) [_**Vendor lock-in**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) (_also known as [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly)_), [_**duplication of effort**_](https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080222031108AAa6k1e), [_**user powerlessness**_](http://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-hard-to-overcome-feelings-of-powerlessness) (_inability to **improve** the product they love using_) and  [_**project stagnation**_](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/256227/is-there-a-single-word-for-when-something-becomes-neglected-or-forgotten-e-g-a) (_e.g. where a useful piece of software dies because the creator loses interest ... [Google Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wave), [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) and [iGoogle](http://gizmodo.com/all-the-google-products-that-google-itself-has-killed-d-665225668) ... Notice a Trend? Closed Source projects - even moderately successful ones - can be terminated at any time without any consent from people using them! _).

We want _**everyone**_ to be able to use the **dwyl app** regardless of
their financial position; much _closed source_ software _often_ has both a _**high initial/upfront cost**_ (_**Adobe CS** we're looking at you..._) and/or _**recurring cost**_ (_again, **Adobe "Creative Cloud"** or **Salesforce.com**_) or has "zero cost" but then sells your data to the highest bidder (_which we think is **much worse** ... Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, SnapChat, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc._)

We want people to be *guaranteed* the use of the software for as long as they find it useful. Often closed projects get killed by their creators without much warning

If you do not _share_ the belief that Open Source is the _future_ of code, please tell us _**exactly**_ why and give us _**specific example**_ of a situation where you think closed source is better. _Thanks_!

## Frequently Asked Questions (_FAQ_)


#### Q: *Why* did you select the GNU General Public License Version 2 (GPL V.2) ?  
**A**: The question of "_which license should we choose_?" is always
a source of debate. In the end we selected GPL V.2 for the following reasons:  
+ **encourages** (_requires_) people to _perpetuate_ **Open Source**. If
anyone builds on top of our work they are _**required to share improvements**_
+ **dissuades** others from re-distributing our work as **closed** software.

#### Q: If you believe in Open Source _why_ are you _charging_ a monthly fee for _using_ dwyl?

**A**: Sadly, running the infrastructure to host the dwyl app is not free.
We have to pay "_rent_" for the servers, storage and bandwidth which costs money. We aim to be transparent with _everything_ (_especially our finances_). We are charging $X for the service because we have calculated that we can run it sustainably at that rate. We hope to [***Buy Harware***](https://github.com/dwyl/time/issues/153) (_yes, its unfashionable_) to reduce our costs/overheads in the future, meanwhile we expect to build _many **amazing/useful features**_ so that over-time the _**value**_ of the dwyl app increases relative to the monthly _usage fee_ and it will feel like a _**bargain**_ (_especially when compared to Salesforce.com_!)

> _Everyone is still free (and will **always** be) to run the **dwyl app** on their own infrastructure without paying a penny; no "enterprise license" or "community" vs. "pro edition"!_
